1) new adds to function __proto__ and some other elements

2) + callbacks: easy to understand (I guess that's it=) )
   + promise: less code, cleaner, try catch contruction.

3) null - it's nothing, but type of null is {},
    when we declared variable but didn't set the value, it's - undefined,
    when we write a=5, but a wasn't declared, we will get - undeclard;

4) console.error, alert(), debugger.

5) same-origin policy: for example we have 2 windows fb.com and gmail.com. 
We don't want that fb.com could read our mails in Gmail, that is the same-origin policy.
